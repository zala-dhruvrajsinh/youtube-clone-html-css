# YouTube Clone – HTML & CSS

A desktop YouTube UI clone built using **pure HTML and CSS**, focused on layout accuracy, clean structure, and real-world frontend problem solving.

This project demonstrates my understanding of modern CSS layout techniques and my ability to translate a complex UI into working code.
